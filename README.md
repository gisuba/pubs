# pubs
papers, articles

This is a page to be beautified and simplified and above all populated with articles and publications.
The first set will be the Mr. Polly pubs on artificial memory :smile:

[Mr Polly - human memory simulations in SQL databases and the emergence of knowledge](https://github.com/gisuba/pubs/blob/main/2019%20022-LEON_a_01441-Bahr%20Mr%20Polly.pdf)

Mr Polly - the Big Data between your ears: human cognition inspired heuristics for forgetting in databases 
(this is a very naughty paper indeed because forgetful databases send a shiver down your spine)

Excuse me, but this image is to keep you company while you are waiting fir Ardemia, the relational archtecture for Mr. Polly to be posted
